I'd gotten within 20m of this unnamed stone for years before finally letting my feet get wet for a closer look. Near the famous Cockpit stone circle this old boundary marker is visible on the skyline when approaching from South East (as I always do, walking from nearby Helton), it's on top of an embankment above the Elder Beck and at least coming from that direction impossible to get to without getting wet. The beck itself would have been the old boundary and it's not visible unless you're close to it so the boundary marker would have been very useful.
