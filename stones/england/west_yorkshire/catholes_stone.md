I heard about the Catholes Stone from [Chris Goddard's book 'The West Yorkshire Moors'](https://christophergoddard.net/product/west-yorkshire-moors/). Lost for years then rediscovered in 1953 by pupils from nearby Robinwood School, it's in a fairly difficult to reach location with no footpaths and heather growing over a meter high.

The inscription reads IESU DEUS DOMINUS MONTIUM: Jesus, God, Lord of the Mountains.

I approached from the west side of the clough, climbing down to the brook, jumped across then found my way up through the heather. To the south I spotted larger groups of rocks so headed that way to inspect, the Catholes Stone was amongst the first I came across (the coordinates above were taken on the spot and are precise, if you use them finding it should be relatively straightforward).
