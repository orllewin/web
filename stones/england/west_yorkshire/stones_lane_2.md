One of three standing stones in Stones, and the only one that might actually be ancient (a pack horse trail marker set next to a spring). The other two are both likely victorian follies (even unfortunately the very tall one at the end of Stones Lane). There's another similar trail marker in a field near the junction of Sourhall Road and Bacup Road further up the valley towards Bacup.
