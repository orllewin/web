On the Flower Scar Road turnoff, Todmorden, where the tarmacked road becomes Tower Causeway there's an information sign about the 'Flow Scar stone crusher', a huge milling stone used to crush sandstone at Guide Quarry. The stone has been removed (purloined) and moved across the county border to Bacup Natural History Society.
