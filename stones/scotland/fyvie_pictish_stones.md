# Fyvie Pictish Stones

IMAGES MISSING 

Three beautiful Pictish stones unceremoniously built into the walls of a church together with two more recent carvings, four at the base, and a fifth at the roof apex. An information sign at the front of the church reads:

"On the outside of the Church are five interesting stones built in to the East gable.

Above the Tiffany Window is a fleur-de-lys crown, discovered in the Priory field and thought to be a finial from the Priory Chapel.

Below the Tiffany Window are the remaining four stones. The central stone was probably the shaft of a Celtic Cross. This suggests a date between 1000 and 1400 AD. The stone above it - the Rothiebrisbane Stone has an elaborate version of the horse-shoe symbol above another symbol showing three circles within a fourth.

The Baldyquash stone to the left has the elephant and mirror symbols, with crescent and V-rod above. To the right is the Kirkyard stone with double disc and eagle. This stone is obviously incomplete.

The last three are probably earlier than 800 AD in origin and are fine examples of Pictish symbol stones."
